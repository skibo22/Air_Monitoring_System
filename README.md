# Air-Monitoring-System
A system that monitors air quality in a room
 🌍 Air Quality Monitoring System

This project is a compact **Air Quality Monitoring System** built using Arduino. It measures temperature, humidity, and gas concentration (air quality) and displays the data in real-time. The system is ideal for indoor or semi-outdoor air monitoring.
